# Purity's HERO SQUAD Using JAVA

#### This project is about Creating an app that allows you to recruit a well-balanced team of superheroes


#### By **Purity Munene**

## Description

The Hero Squad application allows users to recruit a well-balanced team of superheroes for various causes. One creates heroes with names, ages, special powers, and weaknesses. Also forms squads with a maximum size, a name, and a cause they are dedicated to fighting. Heroes can be assigned to squads, but each hero can only participate in one squad at a time.

This project serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate my skills in Java development, object-oriented programming, and web application development using Spark framework.
